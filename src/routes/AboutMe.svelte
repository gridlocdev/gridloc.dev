	<p>
		I've been working as a professional .NET software engineer since 2019 for a large-scale
		organization, and have experience in most areas of the web technology stack.

	<ul class="list-[square] pl-10">
		<li>Building server-side web applications</li>
		<li>Creating CI/CD pipelines</li>
		<li>Managing Windows servers with IIS</li>
		<li>Architecting relational databases</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		As a nerd, I have always enjoyed the creative process of putting ideas into practice in a way
		that is either valuable or just plain fun, and I've found that software is the perfect medium
		for that type of thing.
	</p>
	<p />
	<p>
		I look forward to the future of the medium, and seeing what types of cool opportunities present
		themselves.
