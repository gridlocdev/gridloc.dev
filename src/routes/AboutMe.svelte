			I'm a software engineer that typically does large, complicated enterprise projects for work,
			but I like to make small, fun bits of software like this on the side.
			<br><br>
			Large projects great and rewarding, and (pretty much always) provide more value to the world,
			but sometimes I just want to poke at my own brain a bit.
			I think there's a pretty rewarding feedback loop in the process of creating something
			that's useful and interactive.
